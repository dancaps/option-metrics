Options Data Ingestion and Analysis Exercise  
Task  
Your firm has decided to subscribe to a new options data vendor. While the deal is not done 
yet, they have provided a sample CSV file containing two weeks of data for SPX. Your firm 
wants you to use this sample to build out an ingestion and analysis proces s for the data.  
Note: The sample data provided differs from the production format. While this sample 
contains two weeks of options data for a single ticker (SPX) in one file, in production we will 
receive:  
• Daily files (one per day)  
• Each file containing options data for all tickers  
• Files arriving each business day for processing  
Please design your solution with this production scenario in mind, even though you're 
working with the sample format.  
Requirements  
1. Data Ingestion : Load the raw data into a database for safekeeping (PostgreSQL or 
SQLite)  
2. Analysis : Implement at least 2 of the suggested analyses below, saving results in 
new database table (s) 
3. Testing: Include unit tests for your analysis logic  
4. Documentation : Include a README explaining your approach and how to run your 
solution  
Deliverables  
• Script(s) to ingest the data  
• SQL or code to perform your chosen analyses  
• Brief documentation of your design decisions  
Please use Java or Python for any code written.  
Note: We expect this to take approximately 4 -6 hours. Focus on code quality and 
correctness rather than implementing every possible analysis.  
 
 
Input File Specification  
Column Name  Description  
Ticker Unique identifier for the underlying asset (e.g., SPX)  
Date  The observation date (i.e., when this row of data was captured)  
Expiration  The expiration date of the option contract  
T Time to expiration in days  
Strike  Strike price of the option  
CallPut  Type of option: "C" for Call, "P" for Put  
symbol  Ticker-like string identifying the specific option  
BestBid  Current best bid price (highest price a buyer is willing to pay)  
BestOffer  Current best ask/offer price (lowest price a seller will accept)  
Midpoint  Average of bid and ask prices: (BestBid + BestOffer) / 2  
Volume  Number of contracts traded during the observation date  
OpenInterest  Number of open contracts that haven't been closed or exercised  
ImpliedVolatility  Model derived Volatility  
Delta  Sensitivity of option price to changes in underlying price  
Gamma  Sensitivity of delta to changes in the underlying price  
Vega  Sensitivity of option price to changes in implied volatility  
Theta  Sensitivity of option price to time decay (loss of value as 
expiration nears)  
OptionID  Unique identifier for the option contract  
 
Suggested Analyses  
1. Put-Call Ratio  
• Formula : Put Volume / Call Volume  
• Use: Sentiment indicator; put volume > call volume indicates bearish sentiment  
• Implementation ideas :  
o Calculate daily ratios  
o Break down by expiration date ranges  
o Identify significant changes day -over-day  
2. Volume and Open Interest Analysis  
• Outlier Detection : Identify options with statistically significant changes in volume 
or open interest compared to the previous day  
• Implementation ideas :  
o Flag options where volume > 2x average volume  
o Track large changes in open interest (e.g., >50% increase/decrease)  
o Group by strike ranges or expiration buckets  
3. Implied Volatility Analysis  
• Volatility Skew Calculation :  
Background : In theory, options with the same expiration should have similar 
implied volatility regardless of strike price. In practice, they don't - this difference is 
called "skew." Traders pay attention to skew because it reveals market sentiment 
about potential pri ce movements.  
How to calculate  & implementation ideas : 
1. Group options by expiration date or time buckets  
a. Option A – By exact expiration  
i. Pro: Most granular view  
ii. Con: May have too few options per group for reliable averages  
b. Option B – By days to expiration (DTE) buc kets:  
i. 0-7 days (weekly options)  
ii. 8-30 days (short -term)  
iii. 31-60 days (medium -term)  
iv. 61-180 days (long -term)  
v. 180+ days ( very long-term) 
2. Within each group, separate calls and puts  
3. Calculate average implied volatility for different delta ranges:  
a. For calls: Find options with delta between 0.7 -0.8 (these are in -the-
money) and options with delta around 0.5 (at -the-money)  
b. For puts: Find options with delta between -0.3 to -0.2 (these are in -
the-money) and options with delta around -0.5 (at-the-money)  
4. Calculate the skew:  
a. Call Skew = avg(IV of 70 -80 delta calls) - avg(IV of 50 delta calls)  
b. Put Skew = avg(IV of -30 to -20 delta puts) - avg(IV of -50 delta puts)  
4. Custom Analysis  
Feel free to implement any additional analysis you find interesting or valuable.
